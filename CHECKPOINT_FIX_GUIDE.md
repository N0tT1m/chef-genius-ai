# Checkpoint Fix Guide

## Problem Summary

Your checkpoints (29000, 30000) are missing `training_state.pt` files. This was caused by `torch.compile()` wrapping the model, which prevented proper saving of the training state.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Root Cause**: `torch.compile()` wrapper issue
   - When PyTorch compiles a model, it wraps it in a compiled object
   - Saving the wrapper instead of the original model caused issues
   - **Fix**: Unwrap the model before saving using `model._orig_mod`

### 2. **Checkpoint Saving** (`complete_optimized_training.py:1209-1262`)
   - Added unwrapping for `torch.compile()` models
   - Added verification to ensure `training_state.pt` is created
   - Added detailed logging to catch save failures

### 3. **Checkpoint Loading** (`complete_optimized_training.py:830-883`)
   - Made it resilient to missing or empty optimizer/scheduler states
   - Gracefully handles corrupted training states
   - Allows resuming with fresh optimizer if needed

### 4. **Final Model Save** (`complete_optimized_training.py:1053-1072`)
   - Also unwraps `torch.compile()` models
   - Ensures final save works correctly

## How to Fix Existing Checkpoints

You have two options:

### Option 1: Fix a Single Checkpoint (Quick)

```bash
# On Windows PowerShell
python cli/verify_and_fix_checkpoint.py models/chef-genius-flan-t5-large-6m-recipes/checkpoint-30000 --fix
```

### Option 2: Fix All Checkpoints (Recommended)

```bash
# On Windows PowerShell
python cli/fix_all_checkpoints.py models/chef-genius-flan-t5-large-6m-recipes
```

This will:
- Scan all `checkpoint-*` folders
- Create `training_state.pt` for each one with:
  - Correct step count (extracted from folder name)
  - Estimated epoch number
  - Empty optimizer/scheduler states (will restart from scratch)

## Resume Training After Fix

Once you've fixed the checkpoints, resume training normally:

```bash
python cli/complete_optimized_training.py \
  --resume-from-checkpoint models/chef-genius-flan-t5-large-6m-recipes/checkpoint-30000 \
  --model-output models/chef-genius-flan-t5-large-6m-recipes \
  --epochs 3 \
  --batch-size 8
```

The training script will:
1. ‚úÖ Load the model weights from checkpoint-30000
2. ‚úÖ Load the step counter (30000) and epoch number
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Start optimizer and scheduler from scratch (empty states)
4. ‚úÖ Continue training from step 30000

## What You'll See When Resuming

### With Fixed Checkpoint (Empty States):
```
üìÇ Loading training state from .../checkpoint-30000/training_state.pt
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Optimizer state is empty or missing - starting fresh
  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Scheduler state is empty or missing - starting fresh
‚úÖ Resumed from step 30000, epoch 10
```

### Future Checkpoints (After Fix Applied):
```
üìÇ Loading training state from .../checkpoint-31000/training_state.pt
  ‚úÖ Restored optimizer state
  ‚úÖ Restored scheduler state
‚úÖ Resumed from step 31000, epoch 10
   Previous best loss: 0.2345
```

## Trade-offs

### Resuming with Fixed (Empty) Checkpoint:
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: Keep all trained model weights
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: Continue from the correct step count
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Con**: Learning rate will restart (warmup again)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  **Con**: Adam optimizer momentum is lost

### Future Checkpoints:
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: Everything is properly saved
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: Perfect resume with no loss of state
- ‚úÖ **Pro**: Learning rate continues from where it left off

## Verification

To verify a checkpoint is ready to use:

```bash
# Check if training_state.pt exists and is valid
python cli/verify_and_fix_checkpoint.py models/chef-genius-flan-t5-large-6m-recipes/checkpoint-30000
```

Expected output:
```
üìÇ Checking checkpoint: models/chef-genius-flan-t5-large-6m-recipes/checkpoint-30000
  ‚úÖ config.json
  ‚úÖ generation_config.json
  ‚úÖ model.safetensors
  ‚úÖ tokenizer.json
  ‚úÖ tokenizer_config.json

‚úÖ training_state.pt found
  üìä Training state contents:
    - Global step: 30000
    - Epoch: 10
    - Best loss: inf
    - Optimizer state: ‚ùå (will restart)
    - Scheduler state: ‚ùå (will restart)

‚úÖ Checkpoint is valid and ready to use!
```

## Prevention (For Future Training)

The fix has been applied to `complete_optimized_training.py`. All **future** checkpoints will:
1. Properly unwrap `torch.compile()` models before saving
2. Verify `training_state.pt` was created successfully
3. Include full optimizer and scheduler states
4. Allow perfect resume with no state loss

## Questions?

- **Q: Will I lose my training progress?**
  - A: No! The model weights are preserved. Only optimizer momentum is lost.

- **Q: Should I start from scratch instead?**
  - A: No! Resuming from checkpoint-30000 is much better than starting over.

- **Q: Will future checkpoints have this issue?**
  - A: No! The fix ensures all future checkpoints include `training_state.pt`.

- **Q: Can I resume from checkpoint-29000 instead?**
  - A: Yes! Just fix that checkpoint and use it. The fix works for any checkpoint.

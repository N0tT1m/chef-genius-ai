## 🎯 Integration With Existing ChefGenius

### Current System
```
User Photo → [Generic YOLO] → [FLAN-T5-XL] → Recipe
              (30% accuracy)    (Trained ✅)
```

### After Training
```
User Photo → [YOUR Trained Model] → [FLAN-T5-XL] → Recipe
              (85% accuracy ✅)      (Trained ✅)
```

### Code Changes Needed

**1. Update Vision Service (1 line change)**
```python
# backend/app/services/vision_service.py

# OLD:
self.food_model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')  # Generic model

# NEW:
self.food_model = YOLO('models/food_detector/train/weights/best.pt')  # YOUR model
```

**2. That's it!** 🎉

Everything else stays the same:
- ✅ API endpoints work as-is
- ✅ Mobile app works as-is
- ✅ Recipe generation works as-is

## 📱 Mobile App Flow

### Complete Fridge-to-Recipe System

```
1. User opens app
2. Taps "Scan Fridge" button
3. Takes photo of fridge
4. App sends to YOUR API
   ↓
5. YOUR vision model detects:
   - chicken_breast (0.89)
   - broccoli (0.85)
   - cheddar_cheese (0.81)
   - rice (0.78)
   ↓
6. YOUR FLAN-T5-XL generates recipe:
   "Cheesy Chicken & Broccoli Rice Bowl"
   ↓
7. User sees:
   ✅ What's in fridge
   ✅ Recipe to make
   ✅ Step-by-step instructions
   ✅ Can cook immediately!
```

**Total API Cost**: $0.00 per scan ✅

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use W&B for Training Monitoring
```bash
# Login to W&B (free account)
wandb login

# Training will auto-log to W&B dashboard
# View at: https://wandb.ai/your-username/chefgenius-food-detection
```

### Tip 2: Resume Training If Interrupted
```bash
# Training saves checkpoints every 10 epochs
# To resume:
python cli/train_food_detector.py \
  --data data/vision_training/food101_yolo/data.yaml \
  --resume
```

### Tip 3: Train While You Sleep
```bash
# Use screen to keep training running
screen -S training
./quick_start_vision.sh
# Press Ctrl+A then D to detach

# Reattach later:
screen -r training
```

### Tip 4: Test Inference Speed
```python
# Test how fast it is
from ultralytics import YOLO
import time

model = YOLO('models/food_detector/train/weights/best.pt')

start = time.time()
for _ in range(100):
    results = model('test_image.jpg')
end = time.time()

print(f"Average: {(end-start)/100*1000:.1f}ms per image")
# Expected: 20-30ms on RTX 5090
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "CUDA out of memory"
```bash
# Reduce batch size
python cli/train_food_detector.py --batch 16  # instead of 32
```

### "Dataset not found"
```bash
# Check if download completed
ls -la data/vision_training/food-101/images/
# Should see 101 folders (one per food class)
```

### "Low accuracy after training"
```bash
# Train longer
python cli/train_food_detector.py --epochs 200  # instead of 100

# Or use more data (combine datasets)
python cli/merge_datasets.py
```

---

## 📞 Quick Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Setup
./quick_start_vision.sh

# Train
python cli/train_food_detector.py --data data/vision_training/food101_yolo/data.yaml

# Test
python cli/train_food_detector.py --test test_images/

# Check model info
python -c "from ultralytics import YOLO; m = YOLO('models/food_detector/train/weights/best.pt'); print(m.names)"

# Monitor training
tensorboard --logdir models/food_detector/train

# Resume training
python cli/train_food_detector.py --resume
```

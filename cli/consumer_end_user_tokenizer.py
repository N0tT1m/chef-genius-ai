            "[TIPS_START] Kitchen Confidence Building: Start with simple recipes that use ingredients you're familiar with. Read the entire recipe before you begin cooking, and prep all your ingredients first - this is called mise en place and it makes cooking so much more enjoyable! Don't be afraid to taste as you go and adjust seasonings to your preference. [TIPS_END]",
            
            "[TIPS_START] Budget-Friendly Cooking: Shop your pantry first before making a grocery list. Buy seasonal produce for the best prices and flavors. Generic brands often taste just as good as name brands for basic ingredients like flour, sugar, and canned goods. Cook larger batches and freeze portions for easy future meals. [TIPS_END]",
            
            "[TIPS_START] Time-Saving Meal Prep: Dedicate 30 minutes on Sunday to prep vegetables, cook grains, and portion snacks. Invest in good food storage containers - they make a huge difference. Cook double batches of soups, stews, and casseroles to freeze half for later. Pre-made spice blends save time and add instant flavor. [TIPS_END]",
            
            "[TIPS_START] Knife Skills for Beginners: Keep your knives sharp - a dull knife is more dangerous than a sharp one. Use a cutting board that won't slip (put a damp towel underneath). Practice the 'claw grip' to protect your fingers while chopping. Start with softer vegetables like mushrooms and work up to harder ones like carrots. [TIPS_END]",
            
            "[TIPS_START] Flavor Building Basics: Salt enhances other flavors, so taste and adjust as you cook. Fresh herbs added at the end brighten up any dish. Acid (like lemon juice or vinegar) balances rich foods. Toast spices for 30 seconds in a dry pan to intensify their flavor. Don't be afraid to experiment with different flavor combinations!

Sunday prep: wash and chop vegetables, cook grains, and prep snack portions. [FAMILY_DINNER] [BUDGET_FRIENDLY]",
